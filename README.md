# Self Driving Car Simulation

In this project we have developed a Self Driving Car simulation using neural network and pytorch. The car has three sensors in front of it which will check for 
obstacles in front of it. If there is obstacle in front of the car it will change its direction.


Installation

1. Download the zip file
2. There would be three python files 
    a. map.py - Gives and option to reset the whole neural network and helps you create new obstacle on screen
    b. ai.py - Artificial Intelligence behind th Car
    c. mapcommented.py - This is main file where everything is compiled together
3. Run these files on Anaconda or any python IDLE
